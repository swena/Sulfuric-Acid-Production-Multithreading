 Note: Assumptions made : 
 ________________________

1. The Initial & Favourable specifications of machines are pre-defined AS ABOVE . 

2. According to the code made by us , the  specifications  has  been  set, 
   so that if the required amount is > 3 litres , all the 5 stage proccess 
   machines gets overheated & production of 4th lts onwards acid needs  to 
   cool each machine.THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN APPROPRIATELY WHILE PRODUCTION OF 
   4th LITRE (onwards) ACID.

3. This  has  been  done deliberately to introduce and show the concept of  
   temperature in our machine automated manufacturing-plant system.  

4. Following SIGNALS have been handled in our program : 

   a) SIGINT  : signal called for handling (Ctrl+C). 
   b) SIGQUIT : signal called for handling (Ctrl+\). 
   c) SIGALRM : signal called for production of next litre of acid. 
   d) SIGWINCH: signal called when output terminal window size is changed. 
   e) SIGTSTP : signal called for handling (Ctrl+Z). 
   f) SIGUSR1 : signal called if the user enters invalid input. 


Wrong value entered!! kindly re-execute the program and enter a valid value on re-execution.
